Welcome to our Feed-Player React Project! This project provides a modern and user-friendly interface for viewing a series of images and video pulled from RSS, JSON, CSV and YAML. The UI is built using Vite, ReactJS, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The Feed-Player is designed to be fully responsive and packed with a range of features to enhance your viewing experience with filmstrip navigation using [swiper](https://github.com/modelearth/swiper).

## Feed Samples

[View Feeds](view) - The Feed Player is being designed to convert APIs, JSON and .CSV into video-like presentations.
[Bluesky RSS Feeds](view/#feed=bsky) - Click "Turn on CORS passthrough". &nbsp;[About Bluesky RSS](https://bsky.app/profile/todex.bsky.social/post/3kj2xcufu5q2q).

[JSON for video, image and feed links](src/Data/data.js) - Feed APIs are loaded from a [Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1jQTlXWom-pXvyP9zuTcbdluyvpb43hu2h7anxhF5qlQ/edit?usp=sharing)

## Team Projects

Place your name here if you're working on an update.

1.) TO DO: We recently deactivated pre-loading other feeds. Get the dropdown choices (in the upper right) to load the selected feeds. Get the "BigBunny" video to load again.  Provide a more specific error than "No media available".

2.) DONE: Pull the image and video links from a Google Sheet by implementing the Content/ContextGoogle.jsx page which pulls from this [Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1jQTlXWom-pXvyP9zuTcbdluyvpb43hu2h7anxhF5qlQ/edit?usp=sharing) - By Gary

<!--
DONE: Add columns for Title and Description in the Google Sheet - Matt B
-->

3.) DONE: New swiper control and text that scrolls in player.  - Shreyas

4.) TO DO: Show the progress bar for the feed images. Update the progress bar to include multiple clickable sections when there are sequences of images. We could tap Matt B. who worked with the progress bar previously.

5.) IN PROGRESS: Membersense development and implementation using Discord API - Yunbo

<!-- 
Let's revisit this for a modile orienation.
DONE: Aspect ratio of video remains the same when showing landscape image.--><!--To prevent the video height from jumping short briefly: When setCurrentVideoSrc is called to advance the video, insert the current height until the next video loads. Remove the inserted height once the new slide video/image loads into the DOM. (The last video is an example with a different aspect ratio.)-->

6.) IN PROGRESS: Use Vite to add [Swiper Element](https://swiperjs.com/element) in our "[swiper](https://github.com/modelearth/swiper)" repo and provide a filmstrip based on the images in incoming feeds. Place in a "swiper" folder. See [Swiper Element Setup](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-set-up-swiper-element-in-a-react-application/) and [Film-strip sample](https://www.sliderrevolution.com/templates/wordpress-media-gallery) - We'll avoid showing multiple heros at the same time - Srinath

7.) TO DO: Load images into the Feed Player from our [pull from Github](../home/repo/). - Chethan
Embed and show the FeedPlayer when choosing "images" at [/home/repo/](../home/repo/)

8.) DONE: Pull NASA feed into React Feed Player and show images. - Noopur

9.) TO DO: In Javascript feed/view page, pull in multiple Bluesky RSS feed links by passing in a pipe | separated list of feed urls. Add loop when pipes found in the url value in both JQuery feed/view - Noopur : Done

10.) In React Feed Player, using [Feeds tab CSV pull from Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vSxfv7lxikjrmro3EJYGE_134vm5HdDszZKt4uKswHhsNJ_-afSaG9RoA4oeNV656r4mTuG3wTu38pM/pub?gid=889452679&single=true&output=csv), split on the pipe in the React Feed Player. - Noopur

11.) TO DO: Pull the replies for each Bluesky post in the feed. Use the screen-grab technique that we use to grab images from news sites that are listed in the feed. Scrape the posts from the Bluesky website. Grab replies for the top 3 posts. If the process doesn't work, leave the attempt commented out. - Noopur

12.) DONE - List of feeds on right of player with links to /feed/view/#feed= - Kalyan

13.) Hide the "link icon" in the upper right unless a video is being viewed.

### Building Transparency

11.) TO DO: Update javascript in this Building Transparency [template page](/io/template/feed) to allow an API token to be pasted into the "Your API Key" field.

12.) TO DO: Create a Python process using Github Actions that automatically pulls a new Building Transparency API token every 24 hours. See our existing Python for sample of refreshing the API using a username (email) and password.

13.) Supabase integration - Add a process for saving posts, links and comments related to feed items in Supabase within the [Earthscape NextJS repo](../earthscape/app). Save the ids of the RSS feed item hierarchy from BlueSky and relate it to threaded replies.


1.) TO DO: Update the Yarn Build to make the player an embeddable widget. Here's possible <a href="https://chatgpt.com/share/b847e2c7-732b-4f28-b069-7a58bc107d93">setup info in ChatGPT</a>.

In the existing code, we tried to automate copying the index-xxxxxxxx.js and index-xxxxxxxx.css files to feedplayer.js and feedplayer.css within [dist/assets](https://github.com/ModelEarth/feed/tree/main/dist/assets).  We replaced vite.config.js with vite.config-upcoming.js, but it's not working yet (the copy might run before the build completes).  Once generating a consistant .js and .css file name, edit feed/intro.html to use feedplayer.js and feedplayer.css (or whatever .js file name is standard for a Vite widget).  Also adjust so the widget can be played on the main feed/index.html page. Marco shared a link to [How to copy images in DIST folder from assets in Vite js](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/78076268/how-to-copy-images-in-dist-folder-from-assets-in-vite-js)

## New UI and Controls

The Feed-Player interface that is both visually appealing and intuitive to use. The controls have been thoughtfully designed by to provide easy access to the various functionalities while keeping the user experience smooth and engaging.

## Getting Started

To contribute, fork our [four primary repos](https://github.com/ModelEarth?tab=repositories) and clone into your webroot:

      git clone https://github.com/[your account]/localsite.git
      git clone https://github.com/[your account]/feed.git
      git clone https://github.com/[your account]/swiper.git
      git clone https://github.com/[your account]/home.git

### Folders in your website root

```ini
website
├─ home
├─ localsite
├─ swiper
└─ feed
   ├─ README.md
   ├─ dist
   ├─ src
   ├─ view
   ├─ package.json
   ├─ vite.config.js
   └─ .gitignore
```

### Start a web server in your webroot

```
python -m http.server 8887
```

### The primary FeedPlayer pages will be visible here:

[Feed Player - localhost:8887/feed](http://localhost:8887/feed/)
[Feed View - localhost:8887/feed/view](http://localhost:8887/feed/view/)

## Edit and build the "feed" project locally

### 1. Navigate into the feed directory:

```
cd feed
```

If you don't have yarn yet, install it with `npm install --global yarn`
You can check if you have yarn with `yarn --version`

### 2. Install the required dependencies:

Check if yarn is installed:

```
yarn --version
```

Install yarn if you don't have it yet:

```
npm install --global yarn
```

Install the required dependecies:

```
yarn
```

If the package-lock.json file change significantly, revert and
try this yarn install command:

```
yarn install --immutable --immutable-cache --check-cache
```

The command above requires yarn 2 and prevents third-parties from altering the checked-in packages before submitting them. [Source](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58482655/what-is-the-closest-to-npm-ci-in-yarn).  
It's the equivalent to `npm ci` to avoid updating package-lock.json, which occurs with `npm install`.

### 3. Start a development server (optional)

<!--Skip this step. Port 5173 does not currently work because the files are looking for a base path containing "feed".-->

```
yarn dev
```

Or you can skip "yarn dev" and view at [http://localhost:8887/feed/dist](http://localhost:8887/feed/dist)

<!--
Since we might include /feed in the base path, the feed player may not always work at: [localhost:5173/dist](http://localhost:5173/dist/)
-->

### 4. Build the app to the dist folder

```
yarn build
```

View at: [http://localhost:8887/feed](http://localhost:8887/feed/) and [http://localhost:8887/feed/dist](http://localhost:8887/feed/dist)

After building, you may need to manually edit the index-xxxx.js and index-xxxx.css links in intro.html.

## Deploy for Review using Github Pages

Deploy to your fork on GitHub and turn on GitHub Pages for localsite and feed.

Your updates can now be reviewed at:

https://[your account].github.io/feed  
https://[your account].github.io/feed/dist

## About model.earth localsite navigation

We included [localsite navigation](https://model.earth/localsite/) using the following two lines. It's non-relative so changes to the base path won't break the nav. [Source](https://model.earth/localsite/start/).
Another option would be to add localsite as a [submodule](https://model.earth/localsite/start/submodules) or add the localsite github path to the package.json file.

      <link type="text/css" rel="stylesheet" href="https://model.earth/localsite/css/base.css" id="/localsite/css/base.css" />
      <script type="text/javascript" src="https://model.earth/localsite/js/localsite.js?showheader=true"></script>

## Technologies Used

- ReactJS: Building the user interface and managing component-based architecture.
- Vite: Fast and lightweight frontend tooling for development.
- HTML: Structuring the content and layout of the video player.
- CSS and SCSS: Styling the UI components and ensuring responsiveness.
- JavaScript: Adding interactivity and logic to the video player functionality.

Vite is preferable to Create React App (CRA) because Vite does not rebuild the whole app whenever changes are made. It splits the app into two categories: dependencies and source code. Dependencies do not change often during the development process, so they are not rebuilt each time thanks to Vite.
